This repository contains the projects needed in order to build and use some cool AIR Native Extension written by my own for Android platform.

* *AndroidExtensions:* the Flex Library project containing the ActionScript side of ANE

* *AndroidExtensions_Demo:* a simple Flex Mobile (for Android) project showing AndroidExtensions in action

* *AndroidExtensions_Native:* the Java project containing the native Android code exposed to AIR runtime via ANE facilities
